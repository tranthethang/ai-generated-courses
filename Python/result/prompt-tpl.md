- ‚úÖ Self-Assessment Checklist
- üîó Resources & Further Reading
- üêõ Common Pitfalls & Solutions
- üéâ Summary & Next Steps

## CONTENT QUALITY STANDARDS:

### 1. PHP-Centric Approach (CRITICAL):
- ALWAYS compare new Python concepts with equivalent PHP concepts
- Reference Laravel, Symfony, or other PHP frameworks where applicable
- Use PHP developer terminology before introducing Python terms
- Include side-by-side PHP vs Python code comparisons
- Explain why Python approach is different/better/similar to PHP

### 2. Code Quality Requirements:
- ALL code examples must be complete, runnable, and tested
- Include proper error handling in production examples
- Use Python type hints and docstrings consistently
- Provide both simple examples and production-ready code
- Include imports and dependencies clearly
- Add meaningful comments explaining the "why" not just "what"

### 3. Exercise Design:
- **Exercise 1 (Bronze ü•â):** Basic syntax and concept application (30 min)
- **Exercise 2 (Silver ü•à):** Practical problem-solving with multiple concepts (45 min)  
- **Exercise 3 (Gold ü•á):** Real-world scenario with production considerations (60 min)
- Each exercise must have:
  - Clear requirements checklist
  - Starter code template
  - Expected output/behavior
  - Step-by-step hints
  - PHP context/comparison
  - Test cases for validation

### 4. Learning Psychology:
- Start each concept with familiar PHP equivalent
- Use progressive disclosure (simple ‚Üí complex)
- Include "aha moments" connecting PHP to Python
- Address common concerns PHP developers have
- Provide confidence-building quick wins
- Use practical web development scenarios

### 5. Technical Depth:
- Explain not just HOW but WHY Python does things differently
- Include performance considerations and best practices
- Cover security implications where relevant
- Discuss production deployment considerations
- Address scalability and maintainability aspects

## SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:

### Content Structure:
1. **Introduction (10%):** Context setting with PHP comparisons
2. **Theory & Concepts (30%):** Deep dive into key concepts
3. **Practical Examples (30%):** Code demonstrations and explanations
4. **Hands-on Exercises (25%):** Progressive skill building
5. **Assessment & Resources (5%):** Validation and next steps

### Writing Style:
- Professional but encouraging tone
- Use Vietnamese for explanations (avoid overly academic language)
- Include real-world analogies and examples
- Make connections to common PHP development patterns
- Encourage experimentation and exploration

### Code Examples Requirements:
- Minimum 15-20 substantial code blocks
- Include both conceptual examples and production code
- Show evolution from basic to advanced implementations
- Demonstrate error handling and edge cases
- Include testing examples where appropriate

### PHP Integration Focus:
- Dedicate 30% of content to PHP comparisons and migrations
- Show equivalent implementations side-by-side
- Explain migration strategies for existing PHP projects
- Address common questions PHP developers ask about Python

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
Before submitting, ensure:
- [ ] Content reaches minimum 20 A4 pages (8000+ words)
- [ ] All code examples are tested and functional
- [ ] PHP comparisons are accurate and relevant throughout
- [ ] Three exercises have clear success criteria and progressive difficulty
- [ ] Vietnamese language is natural and professional
- [ ] Self-assessment items are specific and measurable
- [ ] Resources are current and high-quality
- [ ] Common pitfalls section addresses PHP developer concerns
- [ ] Content flows logically from basic to advanced concepts

- All sections from lesson-template.md implemented fully
- Content structured exactly as specified in the reference template
- Ready-to-use file that can be saved directly as [lesson-name].md
- Professional formatting with consistent indentation and spacing

**File Structure Requirements:**
